## Key Challenges Addressed:

### 1. Model Catalog Management

- **Challenge**: It is complex to maintain a comprehensive catalog of diverse ML models, complicating the tracking and management of each model's performance and lifecycle.

### 2. Data Integration Complexity

- **Challenge**: Achieving high accuracy in demand forecasting requires the integration of various data sources, including sales data, inventory levels, promotional activities, and external factors like weather. Without a solid data platform architecture, this integration process becomes cumbersome, impacting data quality and accessibility.

### 3. Granularity Versus Aggregate Patterns

- **Challenge**: Aggregate demand trends may not capture local or specific variations accurately, necessitating fine-grained analysis to derive actionable insights. This adds complexity and unpredictability to the forecasting efforts.

### 4. Continuous Model Retraining

- **Challenge**: To counteract seasonal variations and shifts in consumer behavior, demand forecasting models need continuous retraining. A scalable architecture is essential to support this, ensuring ongoing model accuracy and relevance.

### 5. Model Complexity and Scalability

- **Challenge**: Moving towards detailed demand forecasting increases the number and complexity of required models. This rise in complexity demands scalable solutions to meet the computational needs within acceptable service windows.

### 6. Adapting to Many-Model Approaches

- **Challenge**: A many-model approach to demand forecasting introduces significant challenges in model delivery and management. Scalable MLOps practices are crucial for efficiently managing a large portfolio of models, each customized to specific business aspects such as store performance, geographic location, or product categories.

1. Data is initially ingested from various sources into the Bronze layer, kept largely unprocessed for flexibility; data quality processes like deduplication and schema enforcement mainly occur at the Silver layer, establishing it as the source of truth, while the Gold layer presents an aggregated, refined data view for end-use applications.

## Data Sources

In demand forecasting, the accuracy and reliability of predictions significantly depend on the variety and quality of data sources utilized. Various internal and external data sources can provide critical insights for making accurate forecasts. Here are some of the key sources of data commonly used in demand forecasting:

- Sales Data: Historical sales data is the cornerstone of demand forecasting. It includes information on quantities sold, sales periods, and revenue, which helps in identifying patterns, trends, and seasonality in product demand.

- Inventory Levels: Current and historical inventory data, including stock levels, replenishment rates, and lead times, are essential for understanding the supply side constraints and planning for future demand.

- Promotional Information: Data on past and upcoming marketing campaigns, discounts, and special offers are crucial for forecasting demand spikes or dips associated with promotional activities.

- External Economic Indicators: Economic indicators such as GDP growth rates, unemployment rates, consumer spending levels, and industry-specific economic reports can influence demand forecasting, especially for businesses sensitive to economic cycles.

- Weather Data: Weather conditions have a profound impact on the demand for various products. For instance, the demand for air conditioners rises in hot weather, while colder weather increases the demand for heaters.

- Social Media and Web Analytics: Data from social media and web analytics can provide insights into consumer sentiment, emerging trends, and brand engagement, which can influence demand.

- Competitor Activity: Information on competitorsâ€™ actions, such as new product launches, pricing changes, and marketing campaigns, can also affect demand for your products.

- Demographic Information: Population demographics, including age, gender, income levels, and geographic location, help in segmenting the market and forecasting demand more accurately for different segments.

- Event Information: Special events (e.g., sports events, concerts, festivals) can lead to temporary changes in demand patterns, which need to be accounted for in the forecasting process.

- Regulatory Changes: Changes in laws and regulations can impact demand forecasting. For instance, new environmental regulations can increase the demand for green products.

Integrating these diverse data sources into a cohesive demand forecasting model involves sophisticated data processing and analysis techniques. The use of scalable MLOps practices allows for the efficient handling and processing of this data, enabling the deployment of multiple specialized models tailored to specific attributes of the business, such as location or product category. This many-model approach enhances the precision of demand forecasts by accounting for the unique factors influencing demand in different segments of the market.
